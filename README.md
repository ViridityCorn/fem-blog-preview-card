## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Good ol' CSS
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I wanted to try to use only the plainest of HTML and CSS (with a little sprinkle of FlexBox). I want to try to rely less on FlexBox (as I've had problems overusing it before), but it might be soon to pick it up again.
